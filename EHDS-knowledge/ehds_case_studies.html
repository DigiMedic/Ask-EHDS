        <h2>Case Study 1: Cross-Border Healthcare Coordination</h2>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>A 65-year-old German citizen with a complex medical history was traveling in Spain when he experienced a medical emergency.</p>
            
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The Spanish healthcare providers needed immediate access to the patient's medical history to provide appropriate care.</p>
            
            <h3>EHDS Solution</h3>
            <p>Using the EHDS infrastructure, the Spanish hospital was able to securely access the patient's electronic health records from Germany, including his medication list, allergies, and recent test results.</p>
            
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The quick access to comprehensive medical information allowed for prompt and accurate diagnosis, avoiding potential medication errors and unnecessary tests. The patient received appropriate treatment and was stabilized quickly.</p>
            
            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>This case demonstrates how EHDS can significantly improve the quality and safety of cross-border healthcare, ensuring continuity of care for EU citizens traveling within the Union.</p>

        <h2>Case Study 2: Accelerating Rare Disease Research</h2>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>A team of researchers was investigating a rare genetic disorder affecting fewer than 1 in 100,000 people in the EU.</p>
            
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The rarity of the condition made it difficult to gather enough data for meaningful research from any single country.</p>
            
            <h3>EHDS Solution</h3>
            <p>Through EHDS, the research team was able to access anonymized health data from patients across multiple EU countries, creating a much larger dataset for analysis.</p>
            
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The expanded dataset allowed researchers to identify previously unknown genetic markers associated with the disease and discover potential new treatment targets.</p>
            
            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>This case illustrates how EHDS can accelerate research into rare diseases by facilitating access to larger, more diverse datasets, potentially leading to breakthrough treatments for conditions that were previously difficult to study.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Case Study 3: AI-Powered Diagnostic Tool Development</h2>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>A health tech startup was developing an AI algorithm to assist in the early detection of lung cancer from chest X-rays.</p>
            
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The startup needed access to a large, diverse dataset of chest X-rays to train and validate their AI model effectively.</p>
            
            <h3>EHDS Solution</h3>
            <p>Through EHDS, the startup was granted access to anonymized chest X-ray images and associated diagnostic data from multiple healthcare institutions across the EU.</p>
            
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The diverse and comprehensive dataset allowed the startup to develop a more accurate and robust AI model, capable of detecting subtle signs of early-stage lung cancer across various patient demographics.</p>
